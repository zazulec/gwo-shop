## General info
The project was created for the purposes of recruitment. My task was to create a frontend layer with the appropriate requirements.

The application allows the user to:
* browsing available book collections, 
* adding them to the basket,
* shopping operations in the basket,
* purchase of books.

I wrote the application in typescript which was not required in the project, my motivation was to learn this coding language even better.

I am aware that the application is not outstanding in terms of UX / UI. However, that was not her goal, I focused on perfect functionality.
